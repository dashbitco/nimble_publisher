# NimblePublisher

[Online Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/nimble_publisher).

<!-- MDOC !-->

`NimblePublisher` is a minimal filesystem-based publishing engine with Markdown support and
code highlighting.

```elixir
use NimblePublisher,
  build: Article,
  from: "articles/**/*.md",
  as: :articles,
  highlighters: [:makeup_elixir, :makeup_erlang]
```

The example above will get all articles in the given directory,
call `Article.build/3` for each article, passing the filename,
the metadata, and the article body, and define a module attribute
named `@articles` with all built articles returned by the
`Article.build/3` function.

Each article in the articles directory must have the format:

    %{
      title: "Hello world"
    }
    ---
    Body of the "Hello world" article.

    This is a *markdown* document with support for code highlighters:

    ```elixir
    IO.puts "hello world".
    ```

## Options

  * `:build` - the name of the module that will build each entry

  * `:from` - a wildcard pattern where to find all entries

  * `:as` - the name of the module attribute to store all built entries

  * `:highlighters` - which code highlighters to use. `NimblePublisher`
    uses `Makeup` for syntax highlighting and you will need to add its
    `.css` classes. You can generate the CSS classes by calling
    `Makeup.stylesheet(:vim_style, "makeup")` inside `iex -S mix`.
    You can replace `:vim_style` by any style of your choice
    [defined here](https://hexdocs.pm/makeup/Makeup.Styles.HTML.StyleMap.html).

## Examples

Let's see a complete example. First add `nimble_publisher` with
the desired highlighters as a dependency:

    def deps do
      [
        {:nimble_publisher, "~> 0.1.0"},
        {:makeup_elixir, ">= 0.0.0"},
        {:makeup_erlang, ">= 0.0.0"}
      ]
    end

In this example, we are building a blog. Each post stays in the
"posts" directory with the format:

    /posts/YEAR/MONTH-DAY-ID.md

A typical blog post will look like this:

    # /posts/2020/04-17-hello-world.md
    %{
      title: "Hello world!",
      author: "JosÃ© Valim",
      tags: ~w(hello),
      description: "Let's learn how to say hello world"
    }
    ---
    This is the post.

Therefore, we will define a Post struct that expects all of the fields
above. We will also have a `:date` field that we will build from the
filename. Overall, it will look like this:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Blog.Post do
  @enforce_keys [:id, :author, :title, :body, :description, :tags, :date]
  defstruct [:id, :author, :title, :body, :description, :tags, :date]

  def build(filename, attrs, body) do
    [year, month_day_id] = filename |> Path.rootname() |> Path.split() |> Enum.take(-2)
    [month, day, id] = String.split(month_day_id, "-", parts: 3)
    date = Date.from_iso8601!("#{year}-#{month}-#{day}")
    struct!(__MODULE__, [id: id, date: date, body: body] ++ Map.to_list(attrs))
  end
end
```

Now, we are ready to define our `MyApp.Blog` with `NimblePublisher`:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Blog do
  use NimblePublisher,
    build: Post,
    from: "posts/**/*.md",
    as: :posts,
    highlighters: [:makeup_elixir, :makeup_erlang]

  # The @posts variable is first defined by NimblePublisher.
  # Let's further modify it by sorting all posts by descending date.
  @posts Enum.sort_by(@posts, & &1.date, {:desc, Date})

  # Let's also get all tags
  @tags @posts |> Enum.flat_map(& &1.tags) |> Enum.uniq() |> Enum.sort()

  # And finally export them
  def all_posts, do: @posts
  def all_tags, do: @tags
end
```

**Important**: Avoid injecting the `@posts` attribute into multiple functions,
as each call will make a complete copy of all posts. For example, if you want
to show define `recent_posts()` as well as `all_posts()`, DO NOT do this:

```elixir
def all_posts, do: @posts
def recent_posts, do: Enum.take(@posts, 3)
```

Instead do this:

```elixir
def all_posts, do: @posts
def recent_posts, do: Enum.take(all_posts(), 3)
```

### Other helpers

You may want to define other helpers to traverse your published resources.
For example, if you want to get posts by ID or with a given tag, you can
define additional functions as shown below:

```elixir
defmodule NotFoundError do
  defexception [:message, plug_status: 404]
end

def get_post_by_id!(id) do
  Enum.find(all_posts(), &(&1.id == id)) ||
    raise NotFoundError, "post with id=#{id} not found"
end

def get_posts_by_tag!(tag) do
  case Enum.filter(all_posts(), &(tag in &1.tags)) do
    [] -> raise NotFoundError, "posts with tag=#{tag} not found"
    posts -> posts
  end
end
```
